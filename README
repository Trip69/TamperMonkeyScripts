My collection of Tamper Monkey scripts.

##TM_YTMusic.js

Tamper Money script to auto click "continue watching" popup when listening to you tube music and not interacting with
the page for some time.

##TM_GoogleCAPTCHA.js

Tamper Money script to auto click the captcha box stating that you are human. If a captcha is then presented you need
to complete it yourself, though after some time it no longer appears.

##get_js.php

PHP code for providing a dynamically loaded js module for Tamper Monkey to execute. This is useful for debugging and
developing in a getter IDE other than the inbuilt TM one.
